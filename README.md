In the following project you will find a portolio that has function "clicks" when clicked upon. The first list items if clicked on will take you to the corresponding section on the page.

Following that, clicking under Work, the words should take you to a new page and it will do so by opening a new tab instead of refreshing the current page.

Lastly, the "Contact" part, has three functioning features: 


The first one is phone number that when clicked upon should prompt for the phone to make the call directly.
